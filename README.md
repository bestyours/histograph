# Image Preprocessing

The following image processing steps have been employed for the four different manuscripts.

# Graph Representations

`Keypoint`: The first graph representation makes use of characteristics points (so called keypoints) in skeletonised word images $S$. These keypoints are represented as nodes that are labelled with the corresponding $(x,y)$-coordinates. Between pairs of keypoints (which are connected on the skeleton) further intermediate points are converted to nodes and added to the graph at equidistant intervals. Finally, undirected edges are inserted into the graph for each pair of nodes that is directly connected by a stroke.

`Grid`: The second graph representation is based on a grid-wise segmentation of binarised word images $B$ into equally sized segments. For each segment, a node is inserted into the graph and labelled by the $(x,y)$-coordinates of its respective centre of mass. Undirected edges are inserted between two neighbouring segments that are actually represented by a node. Finally, the inserted edges are reduced by means of a Minimal Spanning Tree algorithm.

`Projection`: The third graph representation is based an adaptive and threshold-based segmentation of binarised word images $B$. Basically, this segmentation is computed on the horizontal and vertical projection profiles of $B$. The resulting segmentation is further refined in the horizontal and vertical direction by means of two distance-based thresholds. A node is inserted into the graph for each segment and labelled by the $(x,y)$-coordinates of the corresponding centre of mass. Undirected edges are inserted into the graph for each pair of nodes that is directly connected by a stroke in the original word image.

`Split`: The fourth graph representation is based on an iterative segmentation of binarised word images $B$. That is, segments are iteratively split into smaller subsegments until the width and height of all segments are below certain thresholds. A node is inserted into the graph and labelled by the $(x,y)$-coordinates of the point on the stroke closest to the centre of mass of each segment. For the insertion of the edges, a similar procedure as for `Projection` is applied.

## Graph Normalisation

The resulting graphs or more precisely the $(x,y)$-coordinates of the node labels $\mu(v)$ are normalised by a z-score. Formally, we use normalised coordinates $(x_{\text{Norm}},y_{\text{Norm}})$ derived by

$x_{\text{Norm}} = \frac{x - \mu_x}{\sigma_x} \textrm{ and } y_{\text{Norm}} = \frac{y - \mu_y}{\sigma_y}~~~~,$

where $(\mu_x,\mu_y)$ and $(\sigma_x,\sigma_y)$ represent the mean and standard deviation of all $(x,y)$-coordinates in the graph under consideration.
